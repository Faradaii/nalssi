## Technologies Used  

<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=git,github,kotlin,androidstudio" />  

This application was developed using Git, GitHub, Android Studio, and Kotlin Jetpack Compose as the primary framework.  

## Challenges - Solutions - Impact  

The development of this application faced several challenges since this was my first Jetpack Compose application and involved implementing offline and online accessibility.  

### Challenges  

- Displaying the latest data from the API and rendering it.  
- Providing a favorite city feature and storing it in a database.  
- Structuring the code for future development.  

### Solutions  

- Used the Retrofit dependency to interact with the API.  
- Implemented swipe refresh to fetch the latest data.  
- Used Koin dependency injection to build the architecture.  
- Implemented Room Database to store favorite cities.
-  Attempted to implement NBR to fetch and synchronize data with local storage.  
  
  > For some reason, NBR is not working properly.  

### Impact  

- The application can be accessed both offline and online, but an internet connection is required the first time to fetch new data.  
- The application can successfully store favorite cities.  

## Lessons Learned  

From this project, I learned how to use Kotlin Jetpack Compose as a framework. This application taught me how to write more declarative code and use Koin dependency injection.  

- Improved my understanding of Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.  
- Helped me explore NBR (Network Bound Resource).
